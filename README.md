# Etch a Sketch

This repo simulates an Etch a Sketch by using multiple divs to represent different pixels on a screen.
When the user hovers their mouse over any given div, that pixel will permanently change colors. In order
to reset the colors, the user will have to reload the page. This project will focus on my ability to
generate DOM elements using javascript. Along with this, I will be using CSS Grid and trying to dynamically
generate a grid based on a user value.
